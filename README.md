# OSC Chat Tools 
Some shitty osc script I made for Vrchat. Now with UI!
- Feature Requests are encouraged. You need something added? Let me know

OCT Is a standalone Python script used for interacting with Vrchat's OSC
### ~~Just make sure Python is installed on your system, and the code will take care of the rest! [Install Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)~~ Update: Python is not required to be installed on your system



## Open up `osc-chat-tools.exe` and the code will do the rest!

### Side note... the song functionality will show whatever the last thing you were listening to was... including a website or video you were watching. So be careful.

# Keyboard Shortcuts (PC ONLY)
