# OSC Chat Tools 
Some shitty osc script I made for Vrchat
- Feature Requests are encouraged. You need something added? Let me know

OCT Is a standalone Python script used for interacting with Vrchat's OSC
### Just make sure Python is installed on your system, and the code will take care of the rest!

## Open up `osc-chat-tools.py` in your favorite Python debugger to run it.  

# Keyboard Shortcuts (PC ONLY)
- **`P`** Toggle Chatbox
- **`[`** Cycle Mode (Currently modes 1-10)

# Config 
### Configuration is currently located inside the Python script itself, so to edit it, you'll need to open the file in a text editor
